It's a demo project to see how multi modules work

## if the parent has source code.
    - run `mvn clean install`
    - run `mvn spring-boot: run`

## if the parent has only pom and childs are the modules 
    - run `mvn clean install`
    - go to the module which contains main class
    - run `mvn spring-boot: run`
